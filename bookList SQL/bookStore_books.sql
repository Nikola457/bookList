Examining the dolls, forensics makes a shocking discovery—a fingerprint belonging to a young girl, a government minister’s daughter who had been kidnapped and murdered a year ago.\r\n\r\nA tragic coincidence—or something more twisted?\r\n\r\nTo save innocent lives, a pair of detectives must put aside their differences to piece together the Chestnut Man’s gruesome clues.\r\n\r\nBecause it’s clear that the madman is on a mission that is far from over.\r\n\r\nAnd no one is safe.','2022-02-23','Mystery','2022-02-23 11:15:50','2022-02-23 11:03:29',2,'the-chestnut-man_1645614950.jpg'),(41,'Lord Of The Flies','William Golding','Since it was first published in 1954, William Golding\'s classic debut novel has remained a stark allegory of civilization, survival, and human nature. As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and Battle Royale surge in popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world, raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality- and brutal savagery-of their situation sets in.\r\n\r\nA teacher himself, Golding clearly understood how to interest children with a gripping story and strong, sympathetic characters. The novel serves as a catalyst for thought-provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues, not only concerning the capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition, but beyond.\r\n\r\nThe boys\' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Symbolism is strong throughout, revealing both the boys\' capacity for empathy and hope, as well as illuminating the darkest corners of the human spirit. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be.\r\n\r\nOften compared to Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost.','1965-05-31','Drama','2022-02-23 11:16:45','2022-02-23 11:16:45',1,'81WUAoL-wFL_1645615005.jpg'),(42,'Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring','J.R.R Tolkien','Continuing the story begun in The Hobbit, this is the first part of Tolkien’s epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, featuring a striking black cover based on Tolkien’s own design, the definitive text, and a detailed map of Middle-earth.\r\n\r\nSauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power – the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring – the ring that rules them all – which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.\r\n\r\nIn a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.\r\n\r\nPart of a set of three paperbacks, this popular edition is once again available in its classic black livery designed by Tolkien himself.','1951-10-23','Fantasy','2022-02-23 11:19:35','2022-02-23 11:19:35',1,'y648_1645615175.jpg'),(43,'Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\'s Stone','J.K.K Rowling','An irresistible new edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone created with ultra-talented designers MinaLima, the design magicians behind the gorgeous visual graphic style of the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films.

Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.\r\n\r\nGuy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.','2022-02-23','Action','2022-02-23 11:24:42','2022-02-23 11:24:42',1,'13079982_1645615482.jpg'),(47,'1984','George Orvell','No novel of the past century has had more influence than George Orwell’s 1984. The title, the adjectival form of the author’s last name, the vocabulary of the all-powerful Party that rules the superstate Oceania with the ideology of Ingsoc—doublethink, memory hole, unperson, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, Thought Police, Room 101, Big Brother—they’ve all entered the English language as instantly recognizable signs of a nightmare future. It’s almost impossible to talk about propaganda, surveillance, authoritarian politics, or perversions of truth without dropping a reference to 1984. Throughout the Cold War, the novel found avid underground readers behind the Iron Curtain who wondered, How did he know?\r\n\r\nIt was also assigned reading for several generations of American high-school students. I first encountered 1984 in 10th-grade English class. Orwell’s novel was paired with Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, whose hedonistic and pharmaceutical dystopia seemed more relevant to a California teenager in the 1970s than did the bleak sadism of Oceania. I was too young and historically ignorant to understand where 1984 came from and exactly what it was warning against. Neither the book nor its author stuck with me. In my 20s, I discovered Orwell’s essays and nonfiction books and reread them so many times that my copies started to disintegrate, but I didn’t go back to 1984. Since high school, I’d lived through another decade of the 20th century, including the calendar year of the title, and I assumed I already “knew” the book. It was too familiar to revisit.','2022-02-23','Drama','2022-02-23 11:25:36','2022-02-23 11:25:36',1,'original_1645615536.jpg'),(48,'Innocent','Harlan Coben','A brilliant, gripping stand-alone novel from the SUNDAY TIMES bestselling author of CAUGHT.\r\n\r\nMatt Hunter\'s life has already been blown apart once. A fight, a friend in trouble, and the dull crack of someone\'s skull on the concrete cost him four years in jail, and a small sliver of his soul.\r\n\r\nWhen Matt got out he set about rebuilding his life. He carved himself a job as a lawyer and fell in love with a beautiful woman.

The novel follows narrator Nick Carraway, newly arrived to the town of West Egg, Long Island, as his life becomes intertwined with that of Jay Gatsby, his rich and enigmatic neighbour. What ensues is a tale of thwarted love and tragedy as Fitzgerald explores the hollowness of materialism and the corruption of the American Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso includes the short story, Winter Dreams which explores similar themes to The Great Gatsby.','1990-10-04','Drama','2022-02-23 23:45:16','2022-02-23 23:45:16',1,'the_great_gatsby_vv_1645659916.jpg'),(53,'The Maid','Nita Prose','Molly Gray is not like everyone else.
